# Routes
This application uses App Router to navigate between pages. All routes share access to the global state provided by FavoritesContext, allowing consistent management of favorite recipes across the app.


**Home**
Main page for querying recipes
* Includes a search input to query recipes from an external API
* Displays results dynamically
* Users can add any recipe to their favorites

# State Management Structure
This application uses a Context to keep the state of the user's favorite recipes. The FavoritesContext provides global access to a list of favorite recipes, enabling components throughout the app to read, add, remove, search, and analyze favorite items without prop-drilling.

**State** 
* favorites is stored in component state using useState, and synced with localStorage for persistence across sessions
* On component mount, favorites are loaded from localStorage (useEffect), and updates to favorites are saved automatically when the state changes.

**Functionality**
* Add/remove favorites
* Check if an item is a favorite
* Search through favorites
* Retrieve favorites by ID(s)
* Compute favorite-related stats (e.g., average cooking time, top cuisines/diets)
* Clear all favorites

# Components

## FormQuery.js
The FormQuery component is a dynamic, interactive search form that allows users to filter and search for recipes based on multiple criteria. It collects user input, builds a structured query object, and passes it to a parent component using the onSearch callback.

* __Form Fields:__ Includes inputs for keywords, cuisine type, dietary preferences, ingredient inclusion/exclusion, cooking time, calories, and sort options.
* __User Input Management:__ Uses React’s useState to track all form field values in `formData`.
* __Search Logic:__ On submission, the form constructs a `searchParams` object based on filled fields and triggers the onSearch function to query the API.
* __Reset Functionality:__ Provides a reset button to clear all fields back to their default values.
* __Loading State:__ Disables the search button and displays a loading spinner when loading is true.

## RecipeView.js  
The RecipeView component displays a recipe in a visually appealing card format, showcasing brief details like the image, title, summary, health stats, and cuisine types. It also includes interactive elements for favoriting and viewing more information in a modal.

* __Recipe Summary Display:__ Shows the title, summary (with HTML tags stripped), cooking time, servings, health score, diet badges (e.g., Vegan, Keto), and up to 3 cuisine tags.
* __Favorite Toggle:__ Displays a heart icon button that toggles the recipe’s favorite state using the `onToggleFavorite` callback.
* __Modal Integration:__ Optionally includes a "View Recipe" button that triggers a modal (CookingModal) for detailed instructions and ingredients.
* __Responsive Image & Placeholder:__ Displays the recipe image or a fallback placeholder on error.
* __External Link Access:__ Provides a button to open the original recipe source in a new tab.
* __Conditional Rendering:__ Uses props like `isFavorite`, `showFavoriteButton`, and `showCookingModal` to customize behavior and visibility.
* __User Experience Enhancements:__ Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive layout and hover effects for interaction feedback.

## RecipeList.js  
The RecipeList component renders a grid of recipe cards using the RecipeView component. It handles the display logic for the list of recipes returned from a search query and manages the favorite status for each item.

* __Component Reusability:__ Passes props like `showFavoriteButton` and `showCookingModal` to each `RecipeView` for flexible feature toggling.
* __Recipe Count Summary:__ Displays a short message at the bottom to indicate how many recipes are currently shown.
* __Modular Rendering:__ Separates individual recipe display responsibilities to `RecipeView`, maintaining clean separation of concerns.
